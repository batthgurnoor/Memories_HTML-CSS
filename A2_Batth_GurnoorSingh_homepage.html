        <h2>A trip to the beach</h2>
        <p class="date">July 14, 2022</p>
        <p class="description">
          We spent a wonderful day at the beach, playing in the waves, building sandcastles, and enjoying the sun. It was the perfect summer day and we made so many great memories that will last a lifetime.

        <h2>Graduation day</h2>
        <p class="date">June 22, 2022</p>
        <p class="description">
          It was a proud moment for me and my classmates as we graduated from college. We worked so hard for so many years and finally, all of our hard work paid off. It was a bittersweet moment as we said goodbye to our friends and instructors, but we were excited for the next chapter in our lives.
